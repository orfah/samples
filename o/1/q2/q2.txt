Notes:
Designed using a basic MVc style, as described by Rasmus.  db.inc file is blatantly stolen from him.

Description is limited to 255 chars.  While this field could have been a text box, if 140 chars is good enough for twitter, I figured 255 is enough for a domain description.

We store creation time as a unix integer so we don't have to fiddle with daylight savings time or time zones.  Has a little extra overhead converting to human readable.

Domain name was intially going to be generated by regular expression.  But I couldn't come up with one that matched well enough, so I'm doing a combination of things, including attempting to look up the ip address.

I didn't spend too much time on the js/css for this question, but I did steal your blog header logo.

There is a convenience hook you can pass in to the GET string to view all entries in the db.  Just add "mode=all" on to the url, like so: http://www.legomorph.net/opendns/q2/domain_view.php?mode=all
